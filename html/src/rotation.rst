PLASMA ROTATION AND FIELD ORIENTATION
=====================================

Physical considerations
-----------------------

Sonic rotation can arise in tokamaks from torque due to neutral beam injection.  It is
believed to play an important role in the suppression of turbulence and the formation of
transport barriers through :math:`\exb` shear.  In addition, it
produces a strong centrifugal force that pushes ions toroidally outward, causing them to
redistribute nonuniformly around a flux surface.  As a result of quasi-neutrality, a
poloidally-varying electrostatic potential is generated by the electrons to balance the
density asymmetry.  This induces centrifugal drifts and trapping, in addition to the usual
:math:`\exb` rotation, Coriolis drift, and parallel velocity shear.
Because of their complexity, these centrifugal effects, which are second-order in the main
ion Mach number, are ignored in most neoclassical and gyrokinetic codes.  Inclusion of full
sonic rotation effects is particularly critical for studying transport of heavy impurities,
as the influence of the centrifugal force is amplified by their large mass.

Sonic rotation formalism
------------------------

The rigorous derivation of the gyrokinetic equations for sonic rotation was carried out by Sugama
[Phys. Plasmas 5, 2560 (1998)].  Sugama followed the underlying rotation formulation of Hinton
and Wong [Phys. Fluids 28, 3082 (1985)], who showed that in an axisymmetric system the
zeroth-order flow velocity is

.. math::

   \mathbf{U}_0 = \omega_0(\psi) R^2 \nabla \varphi \; .

It is this scalar flux-function, :math:`\omega_0`, that is the true free (input) function in
neoclassical and gyrokinetic theory.  Here, :math:`\psi` is the poloidal flux.

The Rotation Profile
--------------------

The relevant profile that gives a *complete specification of rotation*
is the potential :math:`\omega_0(r)`, which in defined consistently in GACODE as

.. math::

   \omega_0(r) = -c \frac{d \Phi}{d \psi} \simeq \frac{c E_r }{R B_p} \; .

In the strictest sense, :math:`\Phi(r)` above is the leading-order potential that is constant on
a flux surface.  Because the meaning of :math:`\Phi(r)` is ambiguous in an experimental sense,
it is perhaps most useful to rely on the final expression in terms of :math:`E_r`.  We believe
this form is intuitively appealing and connects most clearly with experimental data.   

Input parameters
----------------

CGYRO has recently been upgraded to implement *full sonic rotation*, whereas GYRO implements
only a reduced model which includes rotation terms that are first-order in the main ion Mach number;
that is, GYRO includes the :math:`\exb` rotation, Coriolis drift, and parallel velocity shear but
not centrifugal dynamics.  In GYRO and CGYRO, the input rotation parameters are as follows:

- :math:`\exb` shearing rate: 

.. math::

    \mathtt{GAMMA\_E} \rightarrow \frac{a}{c_s} \, \gamma_{\rm E} \doteq -\frac{r}{q}\frac{\partial \omega_{0}}{\partial r}

- Rotation shearing rate (PGAMMA in GYRO):

.. math::

    \mathtt{GAMMA\_P} \rightarrow \frac{a}{c_s} \, \gamma_p \doteq -R_0\frac{\partial \omega_{0}}{\partial r}

- Toroidal flow Mach number: MACH

.. math::

    \mathtt{MACH} \rightarrow M \doteq \frac{\omega_0 R_0}{c_s}

Like CGYRO, NEO also implements all sonic rotation terms, including centrifugal effects,
according to the formulation of Hinton and Wong [Phys. Fluids 28, 3082 (1985)].  Neoclassically,
the induced poloidally-varying electrostatic potential leads to the formation of potential wells.
In the banana regime these increase the effective trapped particle fraction, and in the
Pfirsh-Schluter regime increase the effective toroidal curvature.  In both instances, this
may lead to enhanced neoclassical transport.  The NEO input rotation parameters are as follows:

- Rotation rate

.. math::

    \mathtt{OMEGA\_ROT} \rightarrow \frac{a}{v_{norm}} \omega_0

- Derivative of rotation rate

.. math::

    \mathtt{OMEGA\_ROT\_DERIV} \rightarrow \frac{a^{2}}{v_{norm}} \frac{d \omega_{0}}{dr}

and the rotation model controlled by ROTATION_MODEL.


Disambiguation of the different rotation regimes
================================================
Starting from the Fokker Plank equation

.. math::

    \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\vec{v}\cdot \nabla f+(\vec{E}+\vec{v} \times \vec{B})\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}=c(f,f)

in presence of very high rotation (large :math:`v`, so called sonic regime) the Lorentz force term
can become the leading term, and is therefore convenient to isolate it from the FP equation

.. math::

    E_{-1}+\vec{v}_{0}\times\vec{B}/c=0

where the subscript :math:`-1` represents sonic ordering in the drift-ordering expansion in :math:`\rho_\star=\rho_i/a`

Here :math:`\vec{v}_{0}` is a purely toroidal velocity and is species independent

.. math::

    \vec{v}_{0}=&\omega_{0}\,R\,\hat{e}_{\phi}\\
    ~&\omega_{0}\doteq-c\frac{\partial \Phi_{-1}}{\partial \Psi}

where :math:`\Phi_{-1}` comes from the sonic ordering expansion of the potential

.. math::

    \Phi = \Phi_{-1}+\Phi_{0}+\Phi_{1}+\dots

We note that the :math:`\Phi_{-1}` is a flux function, whereas higher orders are a function of the poloidal angle.

Let us highlight how :math:`\omega_{0}` is a purely theoretical quantiy, that cannot be truly measured in the experiment.
This is similar to how, for example, the experiment measure a temperature :math:`T` which is approximately equal to the
thermal temperature :math:`T_0` only if the plasma is close to being thermal:

.. math::

    T &= T_0 + T_1\\
    T &\approx T_0~\mbox{  (if }~T_1\rightarrow 0\mbox{)}

With this analogy in mind we can understand why when the plasma is in a sonic regime, :math:`omega_0` is
approximately equal to :math:`E \times B` component of the perpendicular rotation frequency (which can be measured experimentally):

.. math::

    \Phi \approx \Phi_{-1}\\
    E_r \approx E_{r,-1} = -|\nabla r| \frac{\partial \Phi_{-1}}{\partial \Psi}

from which:

.. math::

    \omega_0 = \frac{c E_{r,-1}}{R B_{p}} \approx \frac{c E_{r}}{R B_{p}} ~\mbox{  (in the sonic regime)}\\
    \omega_1 = \frac{c E_{r,0}}{R B_{p}} \approx 0 ~\mbox{  (in the sonic regime)}

When the plasma is not in a sonic regime (weak toroidal rotation, or slow-flow limit) then all the quantities with subscript
:math:`-1` tend to zero. Following the same logic as above to the next leading order one gets:

.. math::

    \omega_0 = \frac{c E_{r,0}}{R B_{p}} \approx 0  ~\mbox{  (in the weak rotation regime)}\\
    \omega_1 = \frac{c E_{r,0}}{R B_{p}} \approx \frac{c E_{r}}{R B_{p}}  ~\mbox{  (in the weak rotation regime)}

Let us stress how :math:`\omega_0` and :math:`\omega_1` are two different orders of :math:`\omega`, and they are not the
same quantity. The reader should not be fooled by the fact that both :math:`\omega_0` and :math:`\omega_1` can be approximately
equal to the experimental toroidal frequency, since that occurs for two opposite rotation regime limits:
sonic rotation and weak rotation, respectively.
