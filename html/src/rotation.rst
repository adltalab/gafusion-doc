PLASMA ROTATION
===============

Physical considerations
-----------------------

Sonic rotation can arise in tokamaks from torque due to neutral beam injection.  It is
believed to play an important role in the suppression of turbulence and the formation of
transport barriers through :math:`\exb` shear.  In addition, it
produces a strong centrifugal force that pushes ions toroidally outward, causing them to
redistribute nonuniformly around a flux surface.  As a result of quasi-neutrality, a
poloidally-varying electrostatic potential is generated by the electrons to balance the
density asymmetry.  This generates **centrifugal drifts** in addition to the
usual :math:`\exb` rotation, Coriolis drift, and parallel velocity shear.
Because of their complexity, these centrifugal effects, which are second-order in the main
ion Mach number, are ignored in most neoclassical and gyrokinetic codes.  Inclusion of full
sonic rotation effects is particularly critical for studying transport of heavy impurities,
as the influence of the centrifugal force is amplified by their large mass.

Sonic rotation formalism
------------------------

The rigorous derivation of the gyrokinetic equations for sonic rotation was carried out by Sugama
:cite:`sugama:1998`.  Sugama followed the underlying rotation formulation of Hinton
and Wong :cite:`hinton:1985`, who showed that in an axisymmetric system the
zeroth-order flow velocity is

.. math::

   \mathbf{U}_0 = \omega_0(\psi) R^2 \nabla \varphi \; .

It is this scalar flux-function, :math:`\omega_0`, that is the true free (input) function in
neoclassical and gyrokinetic theory.  Here, :math:`\psi` is the poloidal flux.

The rotation profile
--------------------

The relevant profile that gives a *complete specification of rotation*
is the potential :math:`\omega_0(r)`, which in defined consistently throughout
GACODE as

.. math::

   \omega_0(r) = -c \frac{d \Phi}{d \psi} \simeq \frac{c E_r }{R B_p} \; .

In the strictest sense, :math:`\Phi(r)` above is the leading-order potential :math:`\Phi_{-1}(r)`
that is constant on a flux surface.  Because the meaning of :math:`\Phi_{-1}(r)` is ambiguous in
an experimental sense, it is perhaps most useful to rely on the final approximate expression in
terms of :math:`E_r`.  We believe this form is intuitively appealing and connects most clearly
with experimental data.   These issue are described in full detail in the papers of Hinton and
Sugama.

Input parameters
----------------

CGYRO and NEO implement *full sonic rotation* (GYRO implements only a reduced model) according to the
formulation of Hinton and Wong [Phys. Fluids 28, 3082 (1985)].  Neoclassically, the induced poloidally-varying
electrostatic potential leads to the formation of potential wells.  In the banana regime these increase
the effective trapped particle fraction, and in the Pfirsh-Schluter regime increase the effective toroidal
curvature.  In both instances, this may lead to enhanced neoclassical transport.  The code inputs are

Theoretical basis for sonic rotation
------------------------------------

In presence of rapid rotation, where the flow speed :math:`U` is allowed to be of the order of the ion thermal speed, the Lorentz
force term in the the Fokker-Planck equation (see :cite:`hinton:1985`)

.. math::

   \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla f_i + \frac{e}{m_i}(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
   \cdot \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = C_i + S_i

becomes the leading term.  Under these circumstances Hinton and Wong show that

.. math::

    \mathbf{E}_{-1} + \frac{\mathbf{U}_0}{c} \times \mathbf{B} = 0

where the subscripts represents the order with respect to the **drift ordering** in :math:`\rho_i/a`.
Here :math:`\mathbf{U}_0` is a purely toroidal velocity and is species independent.  This ordering is applied to
all fields and moments

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   f_i  & = ~~~~~~~~~~~ f_{i,0} + f_{i,1} + \ldots \\
   \Phi & = \Phi_{-1} + \Phi_0 + \Phi_1 + \ldots \\
   \mathbf{U} & = ~~~~~~~~~~~ \mathbf{U}_0 + \mathbf{U}_1 + \ldots \\
   U_\varphi & =  ~~~~~~~~~~~ U_{\varphi,0} + U_{\varphi,1} + \ldots \\
   U_\theta  & =  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ U_{\theta,1} + \ldots 
   \end{align}

where :math:`U_\varphi \doteq \mathbf{e}_\varphi \cdot \mathbf{U}` is the **toroidal velocity** and :math:`U_\theta \doteq \mathbf{e}_\theta \cdot \mathbf{U}`
is the **poloidal velocity**.  The leading-order sonic flow is toroidal and independent of species
   
.. math::

   \mathbf{U}_0 = \omega_0(\psi) R \mathbf{e}_{\varphi} \quad \text{where} \quad
   \omega_{0}(\psi) \doteq -c \frac{d \Phi_{-1}}{d \psi}

It is important to note that :math:`\Phi_{-1}` is a **flux function**, whereas higher orders are not constant on a flux surface.

Connection to experimental data
-------------------------------

We remark that :math:`\omega_{0}` is a **theoretical quantity** that cannot be measured in the experiment.  This is similar
to the observation that the experimentally-measured temperature :math:`T` is really the sum of the temperatures to all orders,

.. math::

    T = T_0 + T_1 + \ldots \; .

In practice, however, we approximate the equilibrium temperature :math:`T_0` by the measured temperature :math:`T_0 \simeq T`.
For the rotation frequency, we note that the theory shows that the potential always appears in the combination

.. math::

   \Phi_{-1} + \left\langle \Phi_0 \right\rangle 

where an angle bracket denotes a flux-surface average.  By analogy with the temperature, the rotation frequency can related to the
experimentally-measured radial electric field :math:`E_r`, where :math:`E_r = -|\nabla r| d\Phi/dr`, according to
   
.. math::

   \omega_0 + \omega_1 \simeq  \frac{c E_r(0)}{R B_p} \quad\text{where}\quad \omega_1 \doteq -c \frac{d  \left\langle \Phi_0 \right\rangle }{d\psi}

In practice, we can set :math:`\omega_1 = 0` *without loss of generality* and all the rotation is contained in :math:`\omega_0`.
Alternatively, in the diamagnetic rotation limit, we set :math:`\omega_0 = 0` with the rotation contained in :math:`\omega_1`.
Finally, the toroidal velocities :math:`U_{\varphi,0} + U_{\varphi,1}` are treated in the same way.
